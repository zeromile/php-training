Challenge: Split into teams of 2 and, on the White boards, write out a basic HTML page that uses PHP to set a name variable before the HTML and then echo out that variable in the body of the HTML.

Challenge: Same teams, on the white boards, before your HTML use php to set two names with an array and then use a loop in the body of the HTML to echo each name out in ```<p>``` tags.
